value-serializer
================

Serializes the property values of an Javascript object by a given model.

Inspiration:
------------

(Implementation and Integration of 
a Domain Specific Language with 
oAW and Xtext)[http://www.mt-ag.com/fileadmin/user_upload/Spezial/MTAG-Implementation_and_Integration_of_a_DSL.pdf]

Motive:
-------

Separating the generation of the output from the creation of an internal model.

The example only supports a manually creation of the output.

That's okay.

But in the case of the need of an automatically generated output this approach can't solve the problem.

(Next time more...)
